## GH Release Sequence
#### Local Pre-flight checks
- build all configured builds+tests
- test all `release_tests`
- check that all transitive (BUILD+source)files for artifacts & tests match with HEAD
  - else prompt user to commit specified files
- ?check that no '--override_repository' (use '--announce_rc' flag to see effective flags per-config?)
- add configured repo as 'upstream' remote if necessary (tracked remote is a fork & no upstream remote present)
- check that current branch is in-sync with configured repo+branch
  - else prompt user to rebase/pull

#### Remote Pre-flight checks
- check that HEAD commit exists in remote tracking branch
  - else push to remote
- check that HEAD commit exists in (upstream?configured?) repo's configured branch (how determine correct commit if it was merged/squashed?)
  - else prompt user to create PR

#### Publishing the release
- $publish_tag=$next_tag if $publish_commit doesn't have a SEMVER tag
  - else reuse existing tag (prompt user to overwrite release?somehow check if release is identical?)
- check out $publish_commit into $temp_dir
- tag with $publish_tag if necessary
- generate changelog from previous release; contains:
  - incremental commit log (with links to commits)
  - list of changed files and # lines +/- (with links to per-file diffs)
    - ^ broken out by asset, with "common" changes (shared across all assets) listed first
- build release assets using appropriate --config= and --output_base=
- commit & push docs to configured docs branch
- create release notes as "docs links" + changelog
- publish the release
  - if release fails because it already exists & points to different commit, then suggest actions to user
